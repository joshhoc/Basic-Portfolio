      <p>My name is Josh Hochman and I'm currently the Student Success Manager at the Penn Coding Bootcamp program run by Trilogy Education Services and the University of Pennsylvania. I graduated from Brandeis University with an undergraduate degree in International Business. I later earned my Master's in International Economics and Consulting from Northeastern University.</p>
      
      <p>I spent the majority of my professional life in interational education, helping students to study abroad and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. However, as the Student Success Manager of the Penn Coding Bootcamp, my career took a turn towards the Ed Tech space. I fell in love with the ever-changing nature of technology, the challenges it posed to my traditional way of thinking, and the creativity needed to be successful in the field. As time went on, I found myself learning to code right alongside my students. At first, it was in an effort to get better at my job, but it soon morphed into a full on love affair with web development!</p>
