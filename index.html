        <p>My name is Josh Hochman and I'm currently the Student Success Manager at the Penn Coding Bootcamp program run by Trilogy Education Services and the University of Pennsylvania. I graduated from Brandeis University with an undergraduate degree in International Business. I later earned my Master's in International Economics and Consulting from Northeastern University. <br>
        I spent the majority of my professional life in interational education, helping students to study abroad and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. However, as the Student Success Manager of the Penn Coding Bootcamp, my career took a turn towards the Ed Tech space. I fell in love with the ever-changing nature of technology, the challenges it posed to my traditional way of thinking, and the creativity needed to be successful in the field.  As time went on, I found myself learning to code right alongside my students.  At first, it was in an effort to get better at my job, but it soon morphed into full on love affair with web development! </p>
